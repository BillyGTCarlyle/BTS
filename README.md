# The BrillianT Spectral fitting code

The BrillianT Spectral (BTS) fitting code is a python module designed to be a fully-automated multiple-component fitter for optically-thin spectra. The code is open-source and can be downloaded here. We ask that if the code is used in a publication that the Clarke et al. 2018 paper, which shows the first use, a description and tests of the code, is cited.
